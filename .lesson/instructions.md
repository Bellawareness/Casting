# Instructions  
### Description:
In this activity you will learn how to cast objects. You will create a Cat and Rabbit class.
Please follow the steps below:

### Steps:
1) Create a Rabbit and Cat class. Make sure to add a print() method to them like the Dog class has. 
2) Make rabbit and cat objects. 
3) Call the train method with the new rabbit and cat objects. 
4) Add a speed integer variable to the Rabbit class.
5) Set the rabbits name to Floof (like what is happening above to the dog) and its speed to 15. 
6) Add a jump height integer variable for the Cat class. 
7) Make the cats name be Tom and its jump height to 8.
8) Adjust the train2 method so that it checks for a rabbit and a cat just like the dog one. If it is a rabbit object then make it cast the animal object to a rabbit and then print out: rabbit.name + "'s speed is " + rabbit.speed. Do the same for if the animal object is a cat but use the Cats' name with jump height instead of speed.
9) Call the train2 method on Bunny and Tom.

### Test:
Use the test provided. 

#### Sample output:
```
